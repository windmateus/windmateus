## Hi! ✌

My name is Windson Mateus, from Brazil. I am a full stack developer since 1999.
Nowadays, I am working at [SERPRO](https://serpro.gov.br), a brazilian public company that is in charge of hundreds of governamental systems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working at SERPRO with NodeJS, Angular, Java and Spring Boot but I have a very good background in Microsoft technologies just like .NET, SQL Server and ASP Classic
- 🌱 I'm always learning about programming, technology, finance and investments. I like to write about these things and my reflections on my blogs when I have time, like [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/u/windmateus) and:
